# authetication
The backend used is Firebase.


A simple Flutter application to create different types of authentication methods in Flutter and to verify whether it exits or not

The project includes two authentications: one through "email and password" and the second by "phone number".
There are 4 screens all together: login,signup, a verify screen, and then a post screen.
On the first screen, one has to choose the ways
On the second screen, the user enters the Email and Password 
There's an alternate option if someone wants to login with phone number and OTP, then he can opt for the same
If the user already has an existing account, then he can login with the credentials.
In the OTP case, one has to login everytime with the OTP (limited in this case as Firebase has restricted the number of message pushed)
